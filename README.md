## Printing Instructions
- The `Layer` parts and the `sensor holder` should be printed with black filament, the rest doesn't matter.
Select a cool color combination!
- Use the "auto orient" feature of your slicer!


## Assembly instructions
At first, I'd recommend soldering all the components together.
- Solder the power connector to the step-down converter board (back one most likely positive)
- Solder the LED strip to the connector or the step-down converter input as well, so both get 24/12v.
- Solder plus and minus output of the step-down converter to the ESP32 and to the VEML 7700 board.
- Solder SDA to pin 8 on the ESP32 and SCL to pin 10 on the ESP.
- **Flash the ESP (instructions below)**
- Stuff everything into the case and press the power socket into the case (make sure not to short anything).
- Put the lid on and make sure that the corner with the extrusions is above the power socket to hold it in place.
